## Simple Rectangle

This is a lightweight program for calculating Rectangle intersects and adjacency.

## Overview

A combination of OOP and FP are used, refactoring to use either completely can be done if preferred.

Property-based testing is used for testing general behaviour and finding edges cases.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn add
   ```

2. Run unit tests

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. Build it and import it to another project if you are adventurous

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

**es5 / es6 built files will be available in `/lib` and `/es6`**
